# Tubg0at-s-filter-based-on-Kryzard-s-
pd2 loooooooooooooooot filter
READ ME:

*Waddup grinders. This is a fairly strict filter.
Mostly it's for finding runes, gems, charms, and good uniques/rares.
Mid tier uniques and rares are still in, but are distinguished from the poggers.
Poggers items will be alert with <<<>>> around them.

*The filter is meant to be customizable, so you can include
runeword or craftable bases that you want to target farm.

*I can help you adjust anything in this filter to fit your needs.

*Just drop by my stream www.twitch.com/tubg0at and drop a follow and I got you.

*Also check out Kryzard who wrote the base for this filter: twitch.tv/kryszard.

Stay safe and I wish you many-a-ber drops.
